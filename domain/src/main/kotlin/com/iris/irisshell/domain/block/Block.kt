/**
 * A single terminal "block": one prompt + command + output cycle.
 *
 * Inspired by the HUD terminal concept (`docs/mockups/my-wroted-block-output-mockup.html`)
 * — each block is rendered as one card with:
 *   - a HUD header (exit code, duration, network delta, copy, collapse)
 *   - a connected body (input row always visible + collapsible output)
 *
 * Persistence: in-memory only (MVP). Blocks are dropped when the session
 * closes. A 5000-line ring buffer inside the engine prevents unbounded growth.
 *
 * Command boundary detection is handled by the `BlockEngine` via three
 * layered signals (OSC 133, ANSI cursor, prompt regex) — see
 * `docs/block-engine/PLAN.md` §7.
 *
 * UNTESTED — verify before use.
