# Iris Shell - consumer ProGuard rules for :data.
# These rules are applied automatically to any module that depends on :data.
#
# Keep rules will be added per-phase as libraries are integrated into this module.
# Phase-relevant libraries here: Room, DataStore, OkHttp, SSHJ, Security Crypto.

# Hilt-injected classes in :data — R8 full mode strips them when they are
# only referenced through Hilt-generated code.
